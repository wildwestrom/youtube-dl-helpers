* youtube-dl helper script
This program just allows me to select a format from a list and download it with a single command.
I may make this more sophisticated in the future.

** Usage
You must have the following on your system:
- youtube-dl
- babashka

Make the script executable with ~chmod +x script.clj~.
Copy or make a symbolic link to =script.clj= into a directory on your ~PATH~.

For example, I named the link to the script ~ytf~ (youtube format).
#+begin_src shell
  ytf [youtube-link]
#+end_src
